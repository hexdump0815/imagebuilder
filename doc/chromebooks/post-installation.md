now that you are done with installation there are some additional things you want to setup on your device :

- Change username - [the "linux" username doesn't suite my vibe](./post/change-username.md)

- Modifying keyboards keys - [modify specyfic specjal key to your needs](./post/modifying-keyboard.md)

- Modifying hostname - "changeme" sounds very convincing

- Switching desktop environment - [i want my desktop to look diffrent](./post/switch-de.md)

- Fixing firefox touch screen - the touch screen doesn't let me scroll

- Install waydroid - i want to play and use android apps (to be done)

- Setup splash screen - feel need for my boot screen to look nice

- Getting wacom tablets to work - [need to draw something on my tablet](./post/wacom-tablet-setup.md)
