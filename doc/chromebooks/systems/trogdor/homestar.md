### Notes

**Camera**
camera doesn't work across all [no laptop devices](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Google_Kukui_Chromebook_(google-kukui))

**Speaker**
only 2 speakers (out of 4) work by default

[additional package](https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/discussions/240#discussioncomment-10732006) is required to fix the issue

**Screen**
since the device has oled screen it's possible to make it extreamely dark
by running
```
echo 40 | tee /sys/class/backlight/dp_aux_backlight/brightness
```
useful at night, let's consume even less battery
going below 40 results in screen turning off (increasing brightness with brightness key/shortcut turns it back on)

_Fun fact. tablet based trogdor devices are part of sepret sub-group called ["strongbad"](https://cros.tech/device/homestar/)_
