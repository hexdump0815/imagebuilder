- sometimes a newer precompiled kernel is available than the one used in the
  last available image. how to install it in such a case is described in [here](installing-a-newer-kernel.md)
- I would like to encourage people to build their own kernels from time to time
  or if they want to play around with different kernel options. it is not that
complicated and the procedure to build a new kernel on the system is described
in [here](building-own-kernels.md)
- 64bit arm (aarch64) chromebooks have a special procedure for test booting a
  new kernel which is described in [here](test-booting-a-kernel-on-chromebooks.txt)
