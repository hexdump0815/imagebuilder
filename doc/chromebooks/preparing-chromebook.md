# Intro ... getting stuff to boot

![duet5](./assets/duet5.webp)

in order to get these images to even boot on your device there are some steps you need to do, below you can see all the required steps

# Enabling Developer mode

_Warning. this step will WIPE ALL YOUR DATA from you chromebook so if you have anything of value there, pls copy it somewhere else_

### entering the boot menu

**on laptops**

hold ```[esc]```+```[refresh]``` and press ```[power]```/```[lock]```

**on tablets**

turn off your device and

hold ```[volume-up]```+```[volume-down]``` and press ```[power]```

you should be booted into recovery screen

in here you need to press ```[ctrl]```+```[D]```

press enter to enable developer mode

</details>

<details>
<summary>on older tablets</summary>

you might see recover screen or black screen
![rec](./assets/boot-menu/old-tablets/flash-screen.png)
press both ```[volume-up]```+```[volume-down]```
![en-dev](./assets/boot-menu/old-tablets/dev-enable.png)
navigate to top option (Confirm Dissabling OS verification) and press ```[power]```

_Note. on some devices with a black screen (but led on the side on) mentioned aboved for example lenovo 10e, the screen output is disabled there for whatever reason (the menu is still there though), but don't worry just press both ```[volume-up]```+```[volume-down]``` then press ```[volume-up]``` a few times then confirm with ```[power]```, after that screen output should be there_

after doing this the device should reboot to this screen
![dev-menu](./assets/boot-menu/old-tablets/dev-menu.png)

you can wait 30 secs for device to continue automatically or go to developer options
![bootmenu](./assets/boot-menu/old-tablets/boot-menu.png)
and select to boot from internal disk

</details>

<details>
<summary>on newer devices</summary>

go to advanced options
![rev-menu](./assets/boot-menu/newer-chromebook/rev-menu.webp)

and enable developer mode

![adv-options](./assets/boot-menu/newer-chromebook/adv-opt.webp)

</details>

after your devices finishes you will be able to enter tty from chrome os by pressing ```[ctrl]``` ```[alt]``` ```[->]``` or ```[ctrl]``` ```[alt]``` ```[refresh]``` or ```[ctrl]``` ```[alt]``` ```[f2]```

_Note. on the first boot screen there will be a button to enable debug mode, **don't do that** unless you know what you are doing since it's not needed to access the tty and may make doing it more difficult_

# Preparing usb medium

**Important. simply copying image onto an usb is not a correct way of doing it so please don't do it and then open issues about it not working**

## Flashing on Chromebook or Linux
download the image

using your browser, you can find image for ur specyfic device [here]()

find the name.img.gz (it can be skipped if you already know file location)
```
find / -name *.img.gz 2> /dev/null
```
_Note. 2> /dev/null is for avoiding throwing useless errors and can be removed_

cd to the directory
```
cd path/to/dir
```

unpack the image
```
gunzip name.img.gz
```
find your usb device
```
lsblk
```
_output:_
```
luk@chluk /mnt $ lsblk
NAME         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS
mtdblock0     31:0    0     8M  0 disk 
sda      179:0    0 116,5G  0 disk <-- your usb
â”œâ”€sda1  179:1    0    32M  0 part <-- partition
â”œâ”€sda2  179:2    0    32M  0 part 
â”œâ”€sda3  179:3    0   512M  0 part /boot
â”œâ”€sda4  179:4    0 108,5G  0 part /
â””â”€sda5  179:5    0   7,5G  0 part [SWAP]
```
_Tip. just find a device with same size as ur usb_
_Note. you can also run the command befor and after plugging in the device to be sure_

_Note. your partitions might be different_

flash the image
```
sudo dd status=progress if=name.img of=/dev/<target-device>
```
_Note. replace <target-device> with you usb name from the step above_
_Warning. this operation will wipe your sd/usb drive_

usb should be ready to go ðŸŽ‰

_Note. if there is any problem with any command just add sudo before it_

## Flashing on any other system

for simplicity just use [raspberry pi imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
![rpi-imager](./assets/rpi-imager.png)

if you use diffrent software you are on your own, it should work but **do not create and issue about it not working**

_Note. for most you will need to unpack name.img.gz file using archive tool_

# Booting from usb (or sd)

if you are planning to set [gbb flags](./setting_gbb_flags.md) right away you don't have to do this.

after enabling developer mode enter tty
and type
```
sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1 dev_boot_signed_only=0
```

doing that will enable you to boot from usb/sd card by pressing ```[ctrl]```+```[U]``` at boot menu
![dev](./assets/boot-menu/old-laptop/b.png)

or chosing boot from external device on tablets (developer options->boot from external device)
![dev](./assets/boot-menu/old-tablets/dev-menu.png)
![dev-boot](./assets/boot-menu/old-tablets/boot-menu.png)

or

# What now?

well now that you've  managed to boot the system you might want to install it directly onto the device especially if you used usb (usb for reasons has way slower read/write speed than sd card or chromebooks internall memory)

but before doing it, we recommend you to [set gbb flags](./setting_gbb_flags.md) on your device so when battery runs dry you won't lose access to your system

there are a few ways you could install system

- [regular](./basic-installation.md) - the simplest one, system installed on your device will **not** be encrypted (except browser passowrds, encrypted drives passwords and everything else stored in user database as it is encrypted independently)
- [encrypted](./luks-installation.md) - your entire system will be encrypted, you will be forced to type password everytime you boot your device (not recommended for tablets since there is no on screen keyboard)
- [dualboot](./dualboot-instalation.md) - the system will be installed next to chromeos (in theory it can also be done agains any other linux distro or woa but why?). no encryption unless you fuse this guide with encrypted one.
