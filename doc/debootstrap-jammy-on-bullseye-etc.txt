it looks like bullseye does not bring a fresh enough debootstrap yet
to bootstrap ubuntu jammy - to work around this one should
install the latest sid debootstrap version from:

  https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/debootstrap/download

via:

  dpkg -i deboostrap-some-version.deb

which also requires the zstd package to be installed:

  apt-get -yq install zstd

afterwards debootstrap on bullseye should be able to bootstrap jammy
as well :)
