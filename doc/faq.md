**Q. is there [insert image not listed inside release] image**

A. not really, unless it's available on earlier releases

- when it comes to **ubuntu jammy** - you may [request an image](https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/issues/129) (but it will take unspecified ammount of time)
- when it comes to **debian-derrivatives** (not ubuntu)(like kali/raspbian) - you may try adding distro repo to your sources.list, [like here](https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/issues/225#issuecomment-2162170254) **(do not open issues about it, discussions are fine for this)**
- **unrealeated distro** - build it yourself, this framework should have all ya need in scripts directory if you know how to bootstrap your distro **(do not open issues about it, this is out of scope of the project)**
