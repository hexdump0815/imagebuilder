  # for compression, more is the other way around, depends on actual hw
  # with 20 there is a 25-30% win on available memory with a typical
  # usual compression ratio of around 1:3, but only compressed pages
  # are written to the swap space and thus io to emmc/sd is reduced
  # which should be good for the emmc/sd life time as well - this seems
  # to be some kind of a sweet spot for running low performance systems
  # for a longer time without being busy compressing/decompressing the
  # memory all the time ... in some situations up to 35 might be ok, it
  # should be easier to raise the percentage the faster the cpu cores
  # are, the more of them are available and the more physical memory is
  # in the system ... it is a good idea to set the size of the swap
  # space to about 150-200% of the physical memory if enough disk space
  # is available (otherwise 100% is ok too if disk space is short) as
  # with zswap the used swap space is partially counted virtually twice
  # for the compressed memory pages and extra the ones actually swapped
  # out to disk (i.e. not really all shown amount of used swap space is
  # really used on disk, but shown this way to user space tools
