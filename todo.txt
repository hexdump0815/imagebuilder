- fix extend-root.sh to handle sdx devices as well as mmcblkxpypz devices like used with pmos kernels and data partition on emmc
- change default search engine in firefox to duckduckgo.com instead of google (looks like this is complicated)
- add more doc info to the top level readme (initial setup, scripts in /scripts dir etc.)
- maybe add apple m1 support when asahi linux progressed far enough
- maybe create some useable qemu images too
- check potential problem with the systemd-gpt-auto-generator - see: https://github.com/velvet-os/imagebuilder/issues/43#issuecomment-1116133516
- maybe provide kernel headers as well as part of the kernel tar.gz files - see: https://github.com/velvet-os/imagebuilder/issues/31#issuecomment-1111972167
- investigate if its possible to replace the first boot image on newer chromebooks - should be possible and means most probably just to find the proper format, tools to create it and to replace it in the boot flash area
  - this looks way more complicated than initially thought:
    - deleting the vbgfx.bin, font.bin and selected locale_xy.bin via cbfstool results in an ugly white screen with some half corrupted text
    - unpacking the .bin files with some hacked together python script gives a lot of bmp files with graphics and text fragments on white background from which the screens are assembled
      - the cbfs .bin archive format used is defined here: https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot/blob/master/util/archive/archive.h
    - as a result the white background seems to be set in the bootloader and the maximum somewhat easily possible might be a nearly white initial boot screen by replacing all visible bmp fragments with completely white ones of the same size
- recheck the partition flags and check the loadpin kernel option - see: https://github.com/velvet-os/imagebuilder/issues/43#issuecomment-1155224159
- rewrite the emmc luks install document to be more clear and create different sections for the different setups (chromebook, efi, mbr, u-boot etc.)
