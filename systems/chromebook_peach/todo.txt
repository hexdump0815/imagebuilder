- rework sound/ucm to maybe support internal and headset mic too - they are disabled for now
  - the problem seems to be that the kernel cannot open the capture channels (maybe full duplex is not working)
- maybe give the open source panfrost gpu driver a try - see: https://github.com/hexdump0815/imagebuilder/issues/27#issuecomment-1178779950
