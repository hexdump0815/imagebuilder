## generic mainline linux on arm chromebook notes

- https://github.com/hexdump0815/linux-mainline-on-arm-chromebooks/blob/main/readme.md

## kernel build notes

- https://github.com/hexdump0815/linux-mainline-mediatek-mt81xx-kernel/blob/master/readme.mt9
  - based on the chromeos kernel mainline integration tree for the mediatek chromebooks at collabora
- https://github.com/hexdump0815/linux-chromeos-kernel/blob/master/readme.col
  - a chromeos based kernel is used until mainline gets useable on this device

## mesa build notes

- not relevant yet

## priority

- experimental mode

## special notes

- this is just some experimental initial draft to support this system in some
  way
- this is still very much wip and untested, things might work or might not work
- as long as the chromeos kernel is used there is no gpu support and other
  stuff might also not work
- it looks like (at least the initial batch of) corsola chromebooks is a bit
  buggy when trying to switch into developer mode and seems to hang there, so
either an update has to be done first or they have to be restored from the
latest recovery image - then switching to developer mode works properly
