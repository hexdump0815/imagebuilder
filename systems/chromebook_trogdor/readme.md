## priority

- medium: will be worked on and improved from time to time

## special notes

- wifi, bt, basic sound (at least on on lazor and wormdingler) seem to be ok, suspend/resume does not seem to work properly yet if running from usb, when running from emmc it seems to work
- wormdingler: the display rotation will be set properly during the first boot, afterwards it will reboot once automatically and should come up with the display correctly set to landscape mode - so please don't be surprised about the first automatic reboot and be ready with ctrl-u for the second boot :)
- the current sound setup is not complete yet (and broken on homestar right now):
  - headphones and headset mic do not work yet, so better use a small usb audio interface for a headset if needed for now
- on lazor the keyboard backlight can be controlled via /sys/class/leds/cros_ec\:\:kbd_backlight/brightness (values can go from 0-1023)
- when booting from an usb medium the bootup might hang waiting to discover the root device - in such cases it might help to shortly unplug and replug the usb medium the system is booted from
