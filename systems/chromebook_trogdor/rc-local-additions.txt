# this will give a slight improvement for emmc speed by relaxig some memory protections
# it increases emmc speed by aout 15% in some benchmarks
# see: https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/4526 and threads inside
# these lines relax iommu for some devices, relaxing memory
# protection, it is considered it a fine tradeoff because those
