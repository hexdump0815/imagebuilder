- get console support working reliably for v5.10+
  - update: there is some work in progress regarding this issue
  - it works quite reliable for v5.4
  - it works sometimes for v5.10
  - it does not work anymore for v5.12
  - without CONFIG_FBDEV_EMULATION and tegra, kms helper and nouveau buils as modules at least xorg starts reliable for v5.12 (no console or vt's)
  - seems to be related to drm initialization order
    - working:
      ```
      [drm] Initialized tegra 0.0.0 20120330 for drm on minor 0
      drm drm: [drm] fb0: tegradrmfb frame buffer device
      ```
    - not working:
      ```
      drm drm: [drm] fb0: tegradrmfb frame buffer device
      [drm] Initialized tegra 0.0.0 20120330 for drm on minor 0
      ```
    - next would be to find a way to force proper order
- get thermal throttling (soctherm) working
  - currently cpu speed is limited in rc.local to 1.7ghz to avoid shutdown due to overheating
  - a new patch to usethe regular kernel cpu freq throttling seems to work quite well
- find a way to reenable the display after resume without the current hack
- maybe get some proper kind of suspend working
  - the current s2idle mode does not really save much energy (the battery will just last slightly longer than with normal use)
  - the lowest lp0 suspend mode does not seem to be supported by mainline and would require some extra firmware (see chromeos kernel - maybe for inspiration)
  - someone from archlinux arm got at least lp1 suspend mode working, but i was not able to reproduce this (i was unable to wake it up again after suspend) - see: https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=12185&sid=054215884699c2b79e457eadb8599012&start=230#p64180

  - see https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/tegra/2021-12-22 for some experiments: lp2 and most probably lp1 seem to basically work, at least when booted with init=/bin/bash suspend/resume worked fine via "rtcwake -m mem -s 15" with a deep mem suspend, fully booted (systemd) the system did a clean shutdown immediately after resume
  - v5.18 update:
    - s2idle works, deep works (i.e. even the display gets restore properly now) with rtcwake and full new xorg, if run via suspend it does not seem to get any wake events (maybe kbd is no longer working during suspend to get the events?)
    - i even had deep suspend once working to the point that it even came back after clicking on the trackpad, but i was not able to reproduce it again - this at least shows that it should be possible to get it working - suspend time in this example was a bit less than a minute
    - i did some battery usage measurements with s2idle resulting in about 4% battery usage per hour vs. only slightly less (3.5%+) with lp1 deep sleep via rtcwake, so with s2idle we already nearly get what is possible with mainline on this system - should still be enough to keep it alive when moving from a to b or over night
    - hibernate fails to jump to system on resume and thus does still not work - hibernate options required to test: see info/generic/btrfs-and-hibernation-info.txt
- get u-boot working properly, i.e. one u-boot working for the 2gb/hd and 4gb/full hd model and properly working display all the time
- it looks like there is a regression in mesa when trying to use the nouveau driver: mesa-21.0.1 works, mesa-21.1.0 does not longer work
  - a test with v5.18.0 and mesa v22.1.0 resulted in the following error when trying to run glxgears with a proper nouveau and newer xorg setup: "... src/gallium/frontends/dri/dri2.c:705: dri2_allocate_textures: Assertion `*zsbuf' failed."
