- find a way to reenable the display after resume without the current hack
  - seems to be somewhat more reliable with v5.18+, but sadly not completely reliable (see below)
- maybe get some proper kind of suspend working
  - the current s2idle mode does not really save much energy (the battery will just last slightly longer than with normal use)
  - the lowest lp0 suspend mode does not seem to be supported by mainline and would require some extra firmware (see chromeos kernel - maybe for inspiration)
  - someone from archlinux arm got at least lp1 suspend mode working, but i was not able to reproduce this (i was unable to wake it up again after suspend) - see: https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=12185&sid=054215884699c2b79e457eadb8599012&start=230#p64180

  - see https://libera.irclog.whitequark.org/tegra/2021-12-22 for some experiments: lp2 and most probably lp1 seem to basically work, at least when booted with init=/bin/bash suspend/resume worked fine via "rtcwake -m mem -s 15" with a deep mem suspend, fully booted (systemd) the system did a clean shutdown immediately after resume
  - v5.18/v5.19 update:
    - s2idle works, deep works (i.e. even the display gets restore properly now) with rtcwake and full new xorg, if run via suspend it does not seem to get any wake events (maybe kbd is no longer working during suspend to get the events?)
    - sadly after some more experimentation it looks like that even s2idle suspend is not working reliable - it most of the time comes back after the first suspend, but trying to suspend multiple times usually ends in it failing after a few times (i.e. not coming back) - tested with v5.18.1/v5.19.1/v5.19.2
    - i tried to rule out bt, wifi and sound by blacklisting or moving away their modules, but it did not change anything
    - i even had deep suspend once working to the point that it even came back after clicking on the trackpad, but i was not able to reproduce it again - this at least shows that it should be possible to get it working - suspend time in this example was a bit less than a minute
    - i did some battery usage measurements with s2idle resulting in about 4% battery usage per hour vs. only slightly less (3.5%+) with lp1 deep sleep via rtcwake, so with s2idle we already nearly get what is possible with mainline on this system - should still be enough to keep it alive when moving from a to b or over night
    - i did another check to keep the system running idle with firefox with about 40 open tabs and display off and that used about 7% of the battery (around 50wh) per hour, which means about 3.5w per hour which is not that bad
    - hibernate fails to jump to system on resume and thus does still not work - hibernate options required to test: see info/btrfs-and-hibernation-info.txt
- get u-boot working properly, i.e. one u-boot working for the 2gb/hd and 4gb/full hd model and properly working display all the time
- it looks like there is a regression in mesa when trying to use the nouveau driver: mesa-21.0.1 works, mesa-21.1.0 does not longer work
  - a test with v5.18.0 and mesa v22.1.0 resulted in the following error when trying to run glxgears with a proper nouveau and newer xorg setup: "... src/gallium/frontends/dri/dri2.c:705: dri2_allocate_textures: Assertion `*zsbuf' failed."
