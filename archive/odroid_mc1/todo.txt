- find out why the performance is about 20% lower with mainline than with the odroid v5.4 tree (seen with vcvrack)
  - the cpu opp table entries look a bit strange on mainline: the 1.8ghz entry for instance has a lower voltage as the 1.7ghz entry
  - maybe this is the reason for bootup messages like: cpu cpu4: EM: OPP:1700000 is inefficient
- maybe give the open source panfrost gpu driver a try - see: https://github.com/velvet-os/imagebuilder/issues/27#issuecomment-1178779950
